# Git Training
This is a sample Git repository used in my *You don't know Git* talk.

Feel free to clone the repository and run through the *cheat-sheets*.

## Exercise
The goal of this exercise is to simulate working with remote repositories, making changes, and the process of Pull Requests. To get started, perform the following steps:

1. Create your own "fork" of this repository so you have full control over your workflow.
2. "Clone" your fork of the repository so you can work on it locally.
3. Add a remote reference to this original repository named "upstream".
4. Create a separate branch to make your changes.
5. Append the registry.log file with your name
6. Commit your changes
7. Publish your changes to your fork
8. Open a "Pull Request" on GitHub to submit your changes to the upstream repository.
9. Now rebase your branch with the latest work from upstream/master (check with "fetch")
10. Update your PR to reflect these latest changes...
